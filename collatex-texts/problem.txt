Problem:

I have multiple folders for each song. Each folder is named after the song ID and inside every one of them there is a A.xml, B.xml, and V.xml.
I'm writing an XSLT stylesheet where I create one <div type="poem"> that would contain the readings of the three witnesses. 
I need to give and ID to every song, and I intend to do that by using <xs:uri>. 
If I create the following variable:
<xsl:variable name="B" select="//B.xml//div">
