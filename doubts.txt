Doubts and problems:

1. Is it OK to not agree with how <expan> is supposed to be used?
Although the TEI guidelines recommend wrapping the expanded word between the <expan> tag, I want to only
include the letters affected by the abbreviation. In the medieval romance tradition, most often than not, 
abbreviations were used to avoid writing a certain string of characters, not specifically a word so it doesn't make 
much sense to talk about expanded words (but expanded segments).

2. Problem with a particular abbreviature (nasal consonant vs nasalized vowel)

3. "Letras de espera"

4. Two instances of the same phenomenum in the same <rdg>

5. <del><gap reason="unclear"></del>

6. <gap reason="economic"/>

7. Erro de cópia por adiçom vs. <rdg/> ?

8. <expan><ex>e</ex><am>t</am></expan>

9. Transposition of stanzas in A91B195, witness B, and A301B993V581, witness B.

10. B scribal error (recopy third stanza, missing forth stanza) A72B185.
